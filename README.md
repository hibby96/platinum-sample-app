# A Simple Hello World Node Demo 

## Run the application

You can simply use `node app.js` command.


This script creates a simple HTTP server that listens on port 8080 and returns a response with the message "Hello world!" when accessed. You can save this script as app.js in your project directory and then run it using the command node app.js from the terminal.


Those commands will start a http server listening on port `80` 
and if your request `http://localhost:80` you'll see the following output: 
```shell
‚ùØ curl http://localhost:80

Hello World!

```
